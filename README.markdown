Python Bitcoin GPU Miner
=======================================

This is a forked version of m0mchil's version.  I plan on doing some reworking to the client in the near future, for now this exists to be an easy installation version of the library.


## Installation (OSX)


I have only tested this on Mac OSX, but it should work on other *nix variants.

Pre-requisites:

*   XCode
*   Python 2.6.1
*   Boost (for PyOpenCL, see: http://wiki.tiker.net/PyOpenCL/Installation/Mac)

Let's get Boost installed.  My recommended way is through [brew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

``` bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)";
brew install boost;
```

Site back and relax for this one, it took half an hour to compile on my brand new laptop.

Let's get [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) up and running.  This is going to be used to isolate our install of the miner.

``` 
easy_install virtualenv
```

Now let's create our new virtual environment:

``` bash 
virtualenv ~/.miner --distribute --no-site-packages;
cd ~/.miner;
source bin/activate
```

Lastly, we will need to install numpy.  Due to some weirdness with PyOpenCL and the way it expects to find numpy we can't list it as a dependency in setup.py so it needs to be done by hand:

```
pip install numpy; 
pip install https://github.com/unscene/bitcoin-gpu-miner/tarball/master;
```

##Usage

If you want detailed instructions run:

```
gpu_miner --help
```

To join a pooler like mining.bitcoin.cz you could issue the following on a *nix based system:

``` bash 
nohup gpu_miner -o api.bitcoin.cz -p 8332 -u <username>.<password> --pass <password> -d 0 & 
```

This will detach the process from the shell and you can go on your merry way.
